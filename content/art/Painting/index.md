All of the subsequent paintings were made over the course of a few weeks (or even a few months) using a wide variety of mediums: (#1) acrylic paint; (#2) acrylic ink; (#3) oil pastels; (#4) paint markers; (#5) spray paint. With these abstract expressionist paintings, my artwork explores the relationship between human emotion and the visual world around us. In particular, these paintings are multi-layered and multi-faceted, drawing upon deeply rooted religious and spiritual influences. Additionally, these paintings are the embodiment of the mental illnesses that I experience: obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and depression.
