The prompt for this image was 'an abstract self portrait.' Here are the adopted hyperparameters: 1e-5 is the learning rate of the neural network, 16 is the number of hidden layers to use in the neural network, 8 is the number of epochs to run, 256 is the number of times to calculate and backpropagate loss in a given epoch, 4 is the number of samples used for each iteration to calculate the weighted loss, and 4 is the number of generated images to pass before calculating loss.")
