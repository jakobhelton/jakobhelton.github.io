## The American Midwest / Southwest

[**Link to PDF.**](https://jakobhelton.github.io/uploads/TheAmericanMidwestSouthwest_v3.pdf)

_The American Midwest / Southwest is a two-part documentary photography book consisting of 96 photographs shot with 35mm film, 48 of which are black and white photographs, 48 of which are color photographs. The first part of this book documents my time living in South Point, OH and exploring the surrounding regions of Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia. The second part of this book documents my time living in Tucson, AZ and exploring the surrounding regions of Arizona, California, and New Mexico. The book is organized in such a way that photographs from one part of the book will generally have a corresponding photograph from the other part of the book, effectively structuring each part of the book as a mirrored representation of the other part of the book. For example, the last photograph of the first part of the book (48/96) is rather similar to the first photograph of the second part of the book (49/96). These photographs were all developed and scanned by The Darkroom Lab. Here is a list of cameras and lenses used for this project: (#1) Canon EOS Rebel 2000 and Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 STM; (#2) Olympus [mju:] Zoom 105. Here is a list of black and white film stocks used for this project: (#1) Kodak Tri-X 400; (#2) Kodak T-Max 400; (#3) Ilford HP5 400; (#4) Ilford FP4 125. Here is a list of color film stocks that were used for this project: (#1) Fujifilm Superia 400; (#2) Kodak ColorPlus 200; (#3) Kodak Gold 200; (#4) Kodak Portra 400; (#5) Kodak UltraMax 400. This book was constructed in Adobe Photoshop._
