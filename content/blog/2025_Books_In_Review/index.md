The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. In the background image, blue represents light at 0.90, 1.15, and 1.50 microns (filters F090W + F115W + F150W), green is 2.00 and 2.77 microns (F200W + F277W), and red is 3.56, 4.10, and 4.44 microns (F356W + F410M + F444W). The pullout image shows light at 0.90 and 1.15 microns (F090W + F115W) as blue, 1.50 and 2.00 microns (F150W + F200W) as green, and 2.77 microns (F277W) as red.'

I read lots of books in 2025 and tracked all of my progress on Goodreads. In this blog post, I will summarize the books that I read in 2025, starting with some infographics about my reading habits, followed by a ranked ordering of all the books that I read, and concluding with some of the best quotations from these books.

## Information Regarding My Reading Habits

In 2025, I read a total of 80 books from 49 unique authors. These 80 books contained a total of 31,345 pages, which suggests that my average book length was roughly 391.8 pages. For each of these 80 books, I provided a rating and wrote a review on Goodreads. I compiled the most relevant information for these 80 books in a Google spreadsheet. I subsequently analyzed my reading trends using the aforementioned spreadsheet and Python. My reading trends can be observed in the following infographics.

![books/2025_Figure_01.jpg](books/2025_Figure_01.jpg "The first of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings for the 80 books that I read. In general, I typically gave high ratings to the books that I read. More than half of these books received a perfect rating of 5 stars. The lowest rating that I gave was 3 stars. The total number of books receiving 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 star ratings were 0 (0.0%), 0 (0.0%), 6 (7.5%), 28 (35.0%), and 46 (57.5%), respectively.")
![books/2025_Figure_02.jpg](books/2025_Figure_02.jpg "The second of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings minus the average ratings for the 80 books that I read. In general, I typically gave higher ratings than average for the books that I read (as shown by the positive median value of 0.40). More than half of these books received a rating higher than the average (63.8%). On average, I gave ratings that were 0.24 stars higher than average, but with large scatter (as shown by the standard deviation of 0.53).")
![books/2025_Figure_03.jpg](books/2025_Figure_03.jpg "The third of these infographics provides line graphs for the number of pages that I read on a given day. These line graphs are provided as running averages over two timescales: 7-day running averages are shown in blue while 30-day running averages are shown in pink. Averaged over the entire year, I read roughly 92.5 pages per day. I typically read one page per minute (although this is subject to large scatter, depending on the author and genre of the book I am reading). This suggests that I spent roughly 90 minutes per day reading -- roughly 6.4% of my time was spent reading in 2024!")
![books/2025_Figure_04.jpg](books/2025_Figure_04.jpg "Finally, the fourth of these infographics provides a pie chart for the genres of books that I read. In general, I read roughly one piece of fiction for each piece of non-fiction. The works of fiction that I read were predominantly science fiction, but also included collections of short stories, fantasy, historical fiction, horror, mystery, and classics. The works of non-fiction that I read were predominantly related to science, but also included history, politics, religion, and self-help. Compared to 2024, I increased my fractional rate of non-fiction in 2025 by nearly a factor of three!")

## Some Of My Favorite Quotations From All These Books

- **"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?' Tiger got to sleep, bird go to land; Man got to tell himself he understand."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr._
