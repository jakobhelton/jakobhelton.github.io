I read lots of books in 2025 and tracked all of my progress on Goodreads. In this blog post, I will summarize the books that I read in 2025, starting with some infographics about my reading habits, followed by a ranked ordering of all the books that I read, and concluding with some of the best quotations from these books.

## Information Regarding My Reading Habits

In 2025, I read a total of 80 books from 49 unique authors. These 80 books contained a total of 31,345 pages, which suggests that my average book length was roughly 391.8 pages. For each of these 80 books, I provided a rating and wrote a review on Goodreads. I compiled the most relevant information for these 80 books in a Google spreadsheet. I subsequently analyzed my reading trends using the aforementioned spreadsheet and Python. My reading trends can be observed in the following infographics.

![books/2025_Figure_01.jpg](books/2025_Figure_01.jpg "The first of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings for the 80 books that I read. In general, I typically gave high ratings to the books that I read. More than half of these books received a perfect rating of 5 stars. The lowest rating that I gave was 3 stars. The total number of books receiving 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 star ratings were 0 (0.0%), 0 (0.0%), 6 (7.5%), 28 (35.0%), and 46 (57.5%), respectively.")
![books/2025_Figure_02.jpg](books/2025_Figure_02.jpg "The second of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings minus the average ratings for the 80 books that I read. In general, I typically gave higher ratings than average for the books that I read (as shown by the positive median value of 0.40). More than half of these books received a rating higher than the average (63.8%). On average, I gave ratings that were 0.24 stars higher than average, but with large scatter (as shown by the standard deviation of 0.53).")
![books/2025_Figure_03.jpg](books/2025_Figure_03.jpg "The third of these infographics provides line graphs for the number of pages that I read on a given day. These line graphs are provided as running averages over two timescales: 7-day running averages are shown in blue while 30-day running averages are shown in pink. Averaged over the entire year, I read roughly 92.5 pages per day. I typically read one page per minute (although this is subject to large scatter, depending on the author and genre of the book I am reading). This suggests that I spent roughly 90 minutes per day reading -- roughly 6.4% of my time was spent reading in 2024!")
![books/2025_Figure_04.jpg](books/2025_Figure_04.jpg "Finally, the fourth of these infographics provides a pie chart for the genres of books that I read. In general, I read roughly one piece of fiction for each piece of non-fiction. The works of fiction that I read were predominantly science fiction, but also included collections of short stories, fantasy, historical fiction, horror, mystery, and classics. The works of non-fiction that I read were predominantly related to science, but also included history, politics, religion, and self-help. Compared to 2024, I increased my fractional rate of non-fiction in 2025 by nearly a factor of three!")

## Some Of My Favorite Quotations From All These Books

- **"It is easy to assume that the divide between rich countries and poor countries has always existed; that it is a natural feature of the world. Indeed, the metaphor of the divide itself may lead us unwittingly to assume that there is a chasm — a fundamental discontinuity — between the rich world and the poor world, as if they were economic islands disconnected from one another. If you start from this notion, as many scholars have done, explaining the economic differences between the two is simply a matter of looking at internal characteristics… But the story is wrong. The idea of a natural divide misleads us from the start. In the year 1500, there was no appreciable difference in incomes and living standards between Europe and the rest of the world. Indeed, we know that people in some regions of the global South were a good deal better off than their counterparts in Europe. And yet their fortunes changed dramatically over the intervening centuries — not in spite of one another but because of one another — as Western powers roped the rest of the world into a single international economic system. When we approach it this way, the question becomes less about the traits of rich countries and poor countries — although that is, of course, part of it — and more about the relationship between them. The divide between rich countries and poor countries isn’t natural or inevitable. It has been created. What could have caused one part of the world to rise and the other to fall? How has the pattern of growth and decline been maintained for more than 500 years? Why is inequality getting worse? And why do we not know about it?… At one of the most frightening times in our history, with inequality at record extremes, demagogues rising and our planet’s climate beginning to wreak revenge on industrial civilization, we are more in need of hope than ever. It is only by understanding why the world is the way it is — by examining root causes — that we will be able to arrive at real, effective solutions and imagine our way into the future. What is certain is that if we are going to solve the great problems of global poverty and inequality, of famine and environmental collapse, the world of tomorrow will have to look very different from the world of today. The arc of history bends towards justice, Martin Luther King Jr once said. But it won’t bend on its own."**
  - _This quotation is from "The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions" by Jason Hickel (Pages 2-4)._
- **"If scientists are correct in saying that our model of exponential GDP growth lies at the very core of our crisis, then that’s where we need to start when it comes to imagining an alternative future. One crucial first step would be to get rid of GDP as a measure of economic progress and well-being and replace it with something different. There are many alternative measures of success on offer. The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI), for example, starts with GDP but then adds positive factors such as household and volunteer work, subtracts negatives such as pollution, resource depletion and crime, and adjust for inequality. A number of US states, like Maryland and Vermont, have already begin to use GPI as a measure of progress, albeit secondary to GDP. Costa Rica is about to become the first country to do so, and Scotland and Sweden may soon follow. Measuring GPI gives us a completely different picture of society than GDP. If we plot global GPI and GDP together, just for comparison, we see that GPI increased together with GDP up through the mid-1970s and then leveled off — and even began to decrease — while GDP continued to rise. This illustrates how growing GDP no longer translates into a better society. The consequences of shifting to something like GPI are profound. If our governments were driven to maximize GPI, they would be incentivized to create policies that would facilitate good economic outcomes while diminishing bad ones…"**
  - _This quotation is from "The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions" by Jason Hickel (Page 294)._
- **"Ditching the GDP measure and shareholder-value laws is a crucial first step, but it is not enough in and of itself. It might help us refocus our attention, but it doesn’t address the main underlying driver of growth, which is a little bit deeper and more difficult to see, and that is debt. Right now, one of the reasons our economies have to grow is because of debt. Debt comes with interest, and interest means that debt grows exponentially. For a country to pay down its debt over the long term, it has to grow its economy enough to match the growth of its debt. The same is true of a business. If you want to start a business, you’ll probably have to take out a loan. Then, because you have that debt, you can’t just be satisfied with earning enough to pay your employees and feed your family — you also have to turn enough profit to pay off your loan with compound interest. Regardless of whether you’re a country or a business — or even an individual — you’ll find that, without growth, debt piles up and eventually causes a financial crisis. If you don’t grow, you collapse. One way to relieve this pressure is simply to cancel some of the debt… But even debt cancellation would only provide a short-term fix; it wouldn’t really address the root problem, which is the fact that the global economic system runs on money that is itself debt. When you walk into a bank to take out a loan, you assume that the bank is lending you money it has in its reserve — real money that it stores in a basement vault, for example, collected from other people’s deposits. But that’s not how it works. Banks are only required to hold reserves worth about 10 per cent of the money they lend out. This is known as ‘fractional reserve banking.’ In other words, banks lend out about ten times more money than they actually have. So where does that extra money come from, if it doesn’t actually exist? The banks create it out of thin air. They loan it into existence. About 90 per cent of the money that is presently circulating in our economy is created in this manner. In other words, almost every single dollar that passes through your hands represent somebody’s debt. And every dollar of debt has to be paid back with interest as with more work, more production or more extraction. The fact that our economy runs on debt-based currency is one big reason that it needs constant growth. Restricting the fractional reserve banking system would go a long way to diminishing the amount of debt sloshing around in our economies, and therefore to diminishing the pressure for growth. One easy way to do this would be to require banks to keep a bigger fraction of reserves behind the loans they make. But there’s an even more interesting approach we might try: we could abolish debt-based currency altogether. Instead of letting commercial banks create our money, we could have the state create it — free of debt — and then spend it into the economy instead of lending it into the economy. The responsibility for money creation could be placed with an independent agency that is democratic, accountable and transparent. Banks would still be able to lend money, of course, but they would have to back it with 100 per cent reserves, dollar for dollar…"**

- **"We live in an abundant planet and have an economy that produces more than enough for all of us. If we can find ways to share what we already have more fairly, we don’t need to plunder the Earth for more. Equity is the key to a more ecological economy."**
  - _This quotation is from "The Divide: A Brief Guide to Global Inequality and its Solutions" by Jason Hickel (Page 300)._

- **"Have you heard of Amaterasu? It’s a Japanese solar probe… According to their data, the sun’s output is decreasing… It’s not the eleven-year cycle. It’s something else. JAXA accounted for the cycle. There’s still a downward trend. They say the sun is 0.01 percent less bright than it should be… They’re saying that value is increasing. And the rate of the increase is increasing. It’s some sort of exponential loss that they caught very, very early thanks to their probe’s incredible sensitive instruments… JAXA took a good long look at the Petrova line and they say it’s getting brighter at the same rate that the sun is getting dimmer. Somehow or another, whatever it is, the Petrova line is stealing energy from the sun… The sun’s output will drop a full percent over the next nine years. In twenty years that figure will be five percent. This is bad. It’s really bad… The sun’s dying…"**
  - _This quotation is from "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir (Pages 24-25)._
- **"Most notably, a group in Perth sacrificed one of their Astrophage and did a detailed analysis on all the organelles inside. They found DNA and mitochondria. In any other situation, this would have been the most important discovery of the century. Alien life — indisputably alien — had DNA and mitochondria! And… Grumble... A bunch of water... Point is: The inside of an Astrophage wasn’t much different from the inside of any single-celled organism you’d find on Earth. It used ATP, RNA transcription, and a whole host of other extremely familiar things. Some researchers speculated that it originated on Earth. Others postulated this specific set of molecules was the only way for life to occur and Astrophage evolved it independently. And a smaller, vocal faction suggested life might not have evolved on Earth at all, and that Astrophage and terrestrial life have a common ancestor."**
  - _This quotation is from "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir (Page 75)._
- **"Mass conversion. As the great Albert Einstein once said: E = mc^2. There’s an absurd amount of energy in mass. A modern nuclear plant can power an entire city for a year with the energy stored in just one kilogram of Uranium. Yes. That’s it. The entire output of a nuclear reactor for a year comes from a single kilogram of mass. Astrophage can, apparently, do this in either direction. It takes heat energy and somehow turns it into mass. Then when it wants the energy back, it turns that mass back into energy — in the form of Petrova-frequency light. And it uses that to propel itself along in space. So not only is it a perfect energy-storage medium, it’s a perfect spaceship engine. Evolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for a few billion years."**
  - _This quotation is from "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir (Pages 97-98)._
- **"CERN is going to release this paper next week. This is a rough draft. But I know everyone there, so they let me see an advance copy… They figured out how Astrophage stores energy… Long story short: It’s neutrinos… It’s very counterintuitive. But there’s a large neutrino burst every time they kill an Astrophage. They even took samples to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and punctured them in the main detector pool. They got a massive number of hits. Astrophage can only contain neutrinos if it’s alive, and there’s a lot of them in there… Microbiologists have confirmed Astrophage has a lot of free hydrogen ions — raw protons with no electron — zipping around just inside the cell membrane… CERN is pretty sure that, through a mechanism we don’t understand, when those protons collide at a high enough velocity, their kinetic energy is converted into two neutrinos with opposite momentum vectors… Sometimes gamma rays, when they pass close to an atomic nucleus, will spontaneously become an electron and a positron. It’s called ‘pair production.’ So it’s not unheard-of. But we’ve never seen neutrinos created that way… There’s a lot of complicated stuff about neutrinos I wong get into — there are different kinds and they can even change what kind they are. But the upshot is this: They’re an extremely small particle. Their mass is something like one twenty-billionth the mass of a proton… We know Astrophage is always 96.415 degrees Celsius. Temperature is just the velocity of particles inside. So we should be able to calculate the velocity of the particles inside… We know the average velocity of the protons. And we know their mass, which means we know their kinetic energy. I know where you’re going with this and the answer is yes. It balances… Any heat energy above the critical temperature gets quickly converted into neutrinos. But if it drops below critical temperature, the protons are going too slow and neutrino production stops. End result: You can’t get it hotter than 96.415 degrees. Not for long, anyway. And if it gets too cold, the Astrophage uses stored energy to heat back up to that temperature — just like any other warm-blooded life-form… Neutrinos are what’s called Majorana particles. It means the neutrino is its own antiparticle. Basically, every time two neutrinos collide, it’s a matter-antimatter interaction. They annihilate and become photons. Two photons, actually, with the same wavelength going opposite directions. And since the wavelength of a photon is based on the energy in the photon… The mass energy of a neutrino is exactly the same as the energy found in one photon of Petrova-wavelength light. This paper is truly groundbreaking… Neutrinos routinely pass through the entire planet Earth without hitting a single atom — they’re just that small. Well, it’s more about quantum wavelengths and probabilities of collision. But suffice it to say, neutrinos are famously hard to interact with. But for some reason, Astrophage has what we call ‘super cross-sectionality.’ That’s just a fancy term meaning nothing can quantum-tunnel through it. It goes against every law of particle physics we thought we knew, but it’s been proven over and over… It absorbs all wavelengths of light — even wavelengths that should be too large to interact with it… Turns out it also collides with all matter that tries to get by, no matter how unlikely that collision would be. Anyway, as long as an Astrophage is alive, it exhibits this super cross-sectionality…"**

- **"And then Herbert Foster, looking drab and hunted, picked his way through the crowd. His expression was one of disapproval, of a holy man in Babylon. He was oddly stiff-necked and held his arms at his sides as he pointedly kept from brushing against anyone or from meeting any of the gazes that fell upon him. There was no question that being in the place was absolute, humiliating hell for him. I called to him, but he paid no attention. There was no communicating with him. Herbert was in a near coma of see-no-evil, speak-no-evil, hear-no-evil. The crowd on the rear parted for him, and I expected to see Herbert go into a dark corner for a broom or a mop. But a light flashed on at the far end of the aisle the crowd made for him, and a tiny white piano sparkled there like jewelry. The bartender set a drink on the piano, and went back to his post. Herbert dusted off the piano bench with his handkerchief, and sat down gingerly. He took a cigarette from his breast pocket and lighted it. And then the cigarette started to droop slowly from his lips; and, as it dropped, Herbert hunched over the keyboard and his eyes narrowed as though he were focusing on something beautiful on a faraway horizon. Startlingly, Herbert Foster disappeared. In his place sat an excited stranger, his hands poised like claws. Suddenly he struck, and a spasm of dirty, low-down, gorgeous jazz shook the air, a hot, clanging wrath of the twenties… Nobody could do anything for Herbert. Herbert already had what he wanted. He had had it long before the inheritance or I intruded. He had the respectability his mother had hammered into him. But just as priceless as that was an income not quite big enough to go around. It left him no alternative but — in the holy names of wife, child, and home — to play piano in a dive, and breathe smoke, and drink gin, to be Firehouse Harris, his father’s son, three nights out of seven."**

And the fool thing wears out anyway — no matter how much you stuff and protect it! Who really wants one of the things? What’s so wonderful about protoplasm that we’ve got to carry so damned many pounds of it with us wherever we go? Trouble with the world isn’t too many people — it’s too many bodies… If living matter was able to evolve enough to get out of the ocean, which was really quite a pleasant place to live, it certainly ought to be able to take another step and get out of bodies, which are pure nuisances when you stop to think about them."**

- **"What’s going on right now is both really, really complicated and incredibly simple. The incredibly simple part is that the chemistry of the atmosphere is changing. Before the Industrial Revolution there were 280 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and now it's around 420. And that change is all due to human activities, mostly digging up dead stuff and setting it on fire, but also changing the way we use land, cutting down forests. So the atmosphere is fundamentally different now… We’re already seeing this 1.3°C of warming make a big difference. We’re starting to see really extreme, record-shattering events. Things like heat waves that simply would not have happened had the Earth not been warmed by humans changing the chemistry of the atmosphere. It is really well understood that when you warm the whole place up, you get more extreme heat events. Something else we understand really well is that warm air holds more water vapor. And more water vapor in a warmer atmosphere means there is more to dump on us. So we’re seeing an increase in really heavy rainfall and sometimes snowfall events. We also understand where that water vapor is coming from. We know that warmer air is thirstier air and creates increased evaporation just like when you get really hot your body covers you with sweat, so that liquid can be evaporated away from your skin and cool you. The Earth is literally sweating in the heat. We are seeing increased evaporation taking more moisture away from the surface of the Earth, which is creating more severe drought. For example, the southwest of the United States and northern Mexico is having its worst drought in at least 1,200 years. And that’s not because of a massive decline in rainfall. What is driving that drought is much more evaporation of water away from the surface as a result of atmospheric warming… And on top of that, in a warmer world, we get more rain as opposed to snow, so we’re not building up the snowpack as much anymore. And that’s changing spring runoff, which a lot of water managers in the West depend on. So we’re seeing big changes to the water cycle changes in droughts and downpours and floods and soil moisture and runoff. Also, the seas are rising. That’s happening for two reasons. One is because of land ice. Ice sheets on Greenland and Antarctica are melting, so we get water that used to be frozen up on land going into the ocean. The other is because, as you may remember from fifth-grade science class, as things (including water) get warmer, they expand… And those warmer sea surface temperatures, that’s hurricane food — it fuels stronger hurricanes. The number of hurricanes is not necessarily changing, but we are certainly seeing more severe and more rapidly intensifying hurricanes."**

- **"We think about change in terms of this butterfly of transformative social justice. This butterfly has four winglets — butterflies cannot live with one, two, or three; they need all four. One of the winglets is ‘Resist.’ This is directly confronting oppression. That’s the blockades, the strikes, the protests, the boycotts. That’s necessary. We need to get in the face of oppression. You will not put this pipeline through my community; I will chain myself to it. Another winglet is ‘Reform.’ This has to do with policy change, getting inside of our institutions and changing the narrative; making change from the inside. This is a lot of the slow, painful bureaucratic work. And then we have the winglet that I situate myself on. That’s ‘Building.’ Building alternative institutions that try to model our higher values. The freedom schools and co-ops and land trusts and community farms and free libraries… Yes, exactly. And the final winglet is ‘Heal.’ Because there’s no way we can go through 500 years of this BS and not be completely traumatized. We need art and therapy and ritual and spirituality and collective healing. And we need every farm to sign up to be food justice certified for workers’ rights."**

- **"Well, this is the result of decades of billions of dollars being thrown into our media ecosystem from giant oil companies telling us that we need to be afraid of the solutions, telling us we’re going to be forced to follow new laws, that we won’t be able to drive our wonderful, cool cars. Meanwhile, the solutions are awesome. The solutions are just better. It’s borderline utopian. Energy could be free. That’s for starters. Pollution will be mostly gone. The world will be reborn. Probably the future with architecture is going to integrate the natural world. It’s more than Frank Lloyd Wright designing a house with a waterfall going through it. What we’re seeing now is a new type of design for homes, for buildings, where you have moss on the walls, because guess what? Moss works as insulation, it improves the oxygen in the room, and there’s some of it that’s bioluminescent so it can serve as a beautiful night-light. And trees that grow through buildings, buildings covered in vines and plants, common spaces with ponds. And the solar panels are getting smaller and smaller — probably what they’ll look like in maybe twenty years are little triangle-shaped gleaming gems, hitting the sun. They’re going to look beautiful… We could have roads paved, instead of with asphalt or whatever, with solar panels, which is already starting to happen. The solutions are fantastic and the solutions appeal to all of our instincts. If you’re someone who maybe leans more right-wing and you don’t trust big institutions and you want the right to make your own choloes there’s energy independence, unplugging from these giant utilities, not having to be strapped to the grid. And if you’re on the other end of this spectrum and you’re progressive and you belleve in communal life, that’s going to be part of this solution as well. We’re going to be sharing resoures more and more, we’re going to have a world with more common spaces, more parks. You’re going to be getting rid of gas stations, It’s hilarious how fantastic the solution is. And yet there’s a huge amount of propganda and misleading information that’s been put out there when it’s just a glorious new valley with beams of sunshine going through it, The solutions are as enjoyable, wonderful, and life-improving as any thing you can imagine. And necessarily as a result of that, we’re not going to work fifty, sixty hours, seventy hours a week anymore. The workday will shorten. They’re probably going to have to have universal basic income of some sort, because something like 3.5 million people are employed driving trucks around the country. That kind of stuff is going to go away. You’re probably going to have bullet trains that can long haul cargo. But yes, my headline is: The Solutions Are Awesome."**
