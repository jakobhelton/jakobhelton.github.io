I listened to lots of music in 2024, primarily digital media with Apple Music and YouTube, but also analog media with vinyls that I have been collecting. In this blog post, I will summarize the music that I listened to in 2024, starting with the top artists and albums that I listened to on Apple Music, followed by the best live performances that I listened to on YouTube, and concluding with the vinyls that I acquired this year.

## Digital Media | Apple Music

According to Apple Music, I listened to 21,582 minutes of music, which corresponds to roughly 360 hours or 15 days. This means that roughly 4% of my time in 2024 was spent listening to Apple Music! In total, I listened to 441 unique artists and 234 unique albums. I was a top 100 listener for MUST DIE!, a top 500 listener for Pond, and a top 500 listener for Ternion Sound. My top genres were dubstep, electronic, alternative, hip-hop and dance. 

Here were my top artists for the year:
1. [**Daft Punk**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/daft-punk/5468295): _I listened to this artist for 2,224 minutes (or 37.07 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Daft Punk may pretend to be robots -- the members’ gleaming cyborg helmets are among the most recognizable silhouettes in modern music -- but it’s the French duo’s warm, clearly human hearts that make them so beloved. Few acts have done as much to translate electronic music’s sometimes arcane pleasures to pop’s broadly universal contours. Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo and Thomas Bangalter met in school and played briefly in rock band Darlin’ with future Phoenix member Laurent Brancowitz. Shortly after, in 1993, the two regrouped as Daft Punk, trading their guitars for synths and samplers, and paying homage to the silky, hypnotic thump of Chicago house. The duo’s innovation was to take the wriggly, rough-hewn style -- a descendent of disco, rooted in Black and queer communities in America’s cities -- and sand down its edges, giving looped funk basslines both sensuous heft and Gallic panache. Such sound sculpture helped give birth to French Touch, a wildly influential production style whose luxe detailing continues to resonate through dance music decades later. But Daft Punk didn’t linger on its creation; its next two albums, 2001’s "Discovery" and 2005’s "Human After All," largely abandoned house and disco in favor of audacious sample flips from obscure ’70s rock and funk -- and minted a fair number of classics in the process. With songs like “One More Time,” Daft Punk proved its unrivaled ear for a platinum hook; a cut like “Robot Rock”, meanwhile, was pure alchemy, turning a forgotten hard-rock obscurity into an unforgettable anthem. Not only did Daft Punk help popularize electronic music, but its legendary 2006 Coachella performance from inside a neon pyramid helped set the stage for EDM’s turn toward hi-def spectacle in the 2010s. Yet once again, even as the culture was trending in one direction, the duo feinted left: Its 2013 album, "Random Access Memories," released at the height of the EDM boom, all but abandoned obvious digital trappings in favor of slinky organic disco played by real human musicians. Daft Punk introduced Italo icon Giorgio Moroder to a new generation that hadn’t even been born by his ’70s heyday, helping kick off the decade’s disco revival; with Pharrell Williams and Nile Rodgers, it came up with the joyful, effervescent “Get Lucky,” a song so effortlessly delectable that hearing it for the first time was like being reacquainted with a childhood friend. What’s remarkable is that it’s just as powerful on the umpteenth listen. In 2021, the duo announced its breakup after 28 years together, but that has hardly meant the end of the Daft Punk story. A 10th-anniversary edition of "Random Access Memories" came with 35 minutes of unreleased music. Also, in 2023, "Random Access Memories (Drumless Edition)" offered a new iteration on the group’s final studio album. For these robots, it seems, shutting down the operating system is never final._ --->
2. [**Pond**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/pond/501465546): _I listened to this artist for 2,156 minutes (or 35.93 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Stylistic makeovers are a rule of thumb for Pond. Formed in Perth in 2008 as an open-door collaboration centered around eventual Tame Impala members Nick Allbrook, Jay Watson, and Joe Ryan (who does TI’s visuals), the band broke through in their own right on 2012’s "Beard, Wives, Denim," a farm-recorded opus that cleaned up their more experimental impulses for a winking classic-rock vibe. But open jamming and frequent changes in scenery remain essential to Pond’s psych-based sound, even as their glittery sandpit has widened to include funk, disco, glam, and other joyful genres. A proper ensemble with members often swapping roles and songwriting duties alike, Pond have a de-facto frontman in Allbrook, whose star-kissed falsetto perfectly suits the increasingly synthesizer-steeped struts heard on albums like 2022’s free-wheeling "9."_ --->
3. [**A Tribe Called Quest**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/a-tribe-called-quest/1587965): _I listened to this artist for 1,838 minutes (or 36.03 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _With their lush production, inventive rhymes, and quirky personalities, A Tribe Called Quest rewrote the rules for hip-hop with their legendary run in the 1990s -- and created a template that artists have followed decades later. Queens-bred childhood friends Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi White formed the group in the late '80s, and later teamed up with Afrocentric acts like Queen Latifah, Jungle Brothers, and De La Soul to create the Native Tongues collective. A Tribe Called Quest crafted diasporic music that warmly connected different generations of Blackness by merging jazz, soul, and funk samples -- from artists like Grover Washington Jr., Stevie Wonder, and Sly & The Family Stone -- and righteous rhymes that depicted contemporary life with playful sophistication. Songs like "Bonita Applebum," "Check the Rhime," and "Scenario" challenged the hypermasculinity of gangsta rap, produced with live instruments, and groomed electric lyrical chemistry. Albums "The Low End Theory" and "Midnight Marauders" paved a new lane for alternative rap, with musicians like Kanye West, Pharrell, and The Roots citing the group's influence to draw outside of hip-hop's pre-established lines. Tribe enlisted Detroit rap luminary J Dilla for their next two projects before disbanding in 1998 to focus on solo endeavors. But nearly 20 years later, Phife Dawg died, reuniting the remaining members for another LP, "We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service." The timely comeback was crafted amid the budding Black Lives Matter movement and released the week Donald Trump was elected president in 2016, addressing xenophobia and personal loss while seizing the joy they had left -- a fitting eulogy for their multidimensional legacy._ --->
4. [**MUST DIE!**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/must-die/478780211): _I listened to this artist for 1,691 minutes (or 28.18 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _MUST DIE! makes bombastic, elaborately designed dubstep and electro-house tracks incorporating elements of trance, drum'n'bass, hardcore, and numerous other genres. Highly prolific since the early 2010s, he has co-produced tracks with artists like Zomboy, Getter, and Datsik, and his 2014 full-length "Death & Magic" featured guest appearances by the Ragga Twins and Tkay Maidza. He's continued pushing his sound into heavier, more chaotic directions with subsequent singles like the hardstyle-influenced "BLISS 2K" (2019) and the acid trance-tinged "SORROW TECH" (2021), which appeared on his second album, "CRISIS VISION."_ --->
5. [**Ternion Sound**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/ternion-sound/1339144488): _I listened to this artist for 1,300 minutes (or 21.67 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Not available._ --->
6. [**Cage the Elephant**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/cage-the-elephant/267957933): _I listened to this artist for 1,151 minutes (or 19.18 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _The early-2000s garage-rock explosion may have found its epicenters in big cities like New York and London, but its aftershocks could be felt deep into middle America. And right around the time The White Stripes dropped their final album and The Strokes entered a half-decade hiatus, five young men emerged from the heartland to carry the torch for brash and gritty (but undeniably radio-friendly) rock ‘n’ roll. Formed in 2006 in Bowling Green, Kentucky, Cage the Elephant swaggered onto the national stage as if they were Jack White’s little Southern cousins, rolling up sleazy blues riffs, subtly psychedelic production, and singer Matt Shultz’s cocksure charisma into the breakout single “Ain’t No Rest for the Wicked.” But with 2011’s "Thank You, Happy Birthday" (which reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200) and 2015’s "Tell Me I’m Pretty" (which took home the Grammy for Best Rock Album), they shed their blues-rock training wheels for a more melodically focused, festival-ready approach that harkened back to ‘90s alterna-heroes like the Pixies and Oasis. Not only are Cage the Elephant among the few contemporary rock bands who consistently breach the upper reaches of the charts, their modernist, mercurial spin on classic sounds has earned the blessing of legendary iconoclasts like Beck, who drops some freaky dub mojo on “Night Running” from 2019’s Grammy-winning "Social Cues," and Iggy Pop, whose berserker cameo on the 2020 robo-rocker “Broken Boy” is perfectly emblematic of a band that refuses to be caged._ --->
7. [**Brutalismus 3000**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/brutalismus-3000/1530068480): _I listened to this artist for 952 minutes (or 15.87 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Alternately inspired by and bored of the ‘90s-inspired European techno of the late 2010s, Berlin’s Brutalismus 3000 give their sound a shot in the arm by channeling a punk ethos in their work, injecting their political consciousness and anti-establishment spirit into their electronic beats._ --->
8. [**Stevie Wonder**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/stevie-wonder/46726): _I listened to this artist for 753 minutes (or 12.55 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _An impassioned vocalist, prodigious multi-instrumentalist, and visionary producer, Stevie Wonder is a truly transformative figure in the history of popular music. That he’s accomplished it without his sight is both the most astonishing and least remarkable thing about him. First emerging as a child star in the early ’60s, covering Ray Charles standards under the name Little Stevie Wonder, Stevland Hardaway Judkins (born in Saginaw, Michigan, in 1950) would, by decade’s end, graduate to the more sophisticated soul of Motown-defining singles like “For Once in My Life,” showing future teen idols like Justin Timberlake and Justin Bieber how to gracefully age out of kinder-pop novelty. As Black Power politics seeped into the early-’70s cultural landscape, Stevie became a symbol of both the movement’s righteous indignation and its hope for a more socially just world. His staggering run of classic albums -- from 1972’s Talking Book" to 1976’s "Songs in the Key of Life" -- helped lend legitimacy to the LP format for black soul/R&B pop artists who, with few exceptions, were wrongly relegated to singles status. With them, he showed how speaking up and getting down were not mutually exclusive ideals, fashioning a singular style of psychedelic funk where even the grittiest tracks, such as “Higher Ground,” were infused with spiritual uplift. (And in writing, performing, and producing much of the material all on his own, he established the model of artist-as-auteur embraced by funk pioneers like Prince and rap icons like Kanye West.) But even in this fruitfully experimental phase, Stevie was still producing eternal wedding slow-dance standards like “You Are the Sunshine of My Life” and “Isn’t She Lovely,” and as the ’80s beckoned, he effortlessly adapted to the times with the synth-slicked soul of “Part-Time Lover” and the irresistible adult-contemporary serenade “I Just Called to Say I Love You.” While his output slowed after the ’90s, he remains a ubiquitous, towering figure in pop: Whether he’s singing at Barack Obama’s 2009 inauguration or blowing harmonica on Mark Ronson’s 2015 hit album, "Uptown Special," a Stevie Wonder appearance carries all the grandeur and gravitas of a papal blessing._ --->
9. [**Charli xcx**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/charli-xcx/432942256): _I listened to this artist for 693 minutes (or 11.55 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Charli xcx’s creative drive and willingness to take risks has made her one of the most enthralling pop artists of her era. Whether she’s penning defiantly joyous singles like “Boom Clap” or exploring her glitchier, chaotic side on “Vroom Vroom,” Charli’s success comes from her work both in and out of pop music’s formulaic lane. Born Charlotte Aitchison in 1992 in Cambridge, England, to Scottish and Gujarati Indian parents, she took up songwriting at 14, lifting her stage name from her instant messenger handle. On the strength of her MySpace uploads and performances at London raves, she landed a record deal at 18, released the modestly successful darkwave cuts “Stay Away” and “Nuclear Seasons,” and then hit the big time with 2012’s kiss-off anthem “I Love It.” Originally scrapped from her own album for being too poppy, the beat-pounding re-recording by Swedish duo Icona Pop quickly became a worldwide dance-floor favorite. Her goth-tinged debut album, 2013’s "True Romance," and tracks like the psychedelic, Gold Panda-sampling “You (Ha Ha Ha)” soon positioned Charli as the missing link between Grimes’ freak scene, Lorde’s dark melodies, and Carly Rae Jepsen’s sweetness. But while that album and its follow-up, 2014’s synth-poppy "Sucker," brought Charli a few steps closer to mainstream approval, she found more creative freedom among the esoteric, hyperpop wilds of 2016’s "Vroom Vroom" EP and 2017’s twin mixtapes, "Number 1 Angel" and "Pop 2." While stardom eluded her, Charli built a track record as a prolific songwriter and collaborator, penning standard pop hits for Iggy Azalea (“Fancy”) and Selena Gomez (“Same Old Love”), and working with the likes of Lil Yachty, David Guetta, and BTS. Yet Charli shines brightest when she’s illuminating, breaking down, and even critiquing the industry that gives her acclaim. In 2020, a year after the release of her eclectic, star-studded third album, "Charli," she released the intimate "how i’m feeling now," an album written in six weeks during the pandemic with input from fans alongside extensive, real-time video diaries and notes. Two years later, she experimented with the act of selling out on her fourth album, "CRASH," using her major record label’s A&R expertise to write the mainstream pop record she’d always been afraid to release. That album’s success, coupled with a prominent feature (“Speed Drive”) on 2023’s blockbuster "Barbie" soundtrack, brought Charli closer than ever to worldwide appeal. But her response was to turn back to the sounds that inspired her to make music in the first place. Her 2024 album, "BRAT," is a homage to those riotous, sweaty London clubs of her youth, and an introspective -- if not slightly ironic -- look at her pop music journey, one riddled with head-empty euphoria (“Club classics”), dominating swagger (“Von dutch”), and somber sentimentality (“I think about it all the time”)._ --->
10. [**SVDDEN DEATH**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/svdden-death/1236984166): _I listened to this artist for 674 minutes (or 11.23 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Dubstep DJ and producer SVDDEN DEATH is best known for his Marshmello collaborations and onstage theatrics under the VOYD alias. SVDDEN DEATH is the musical alias of San Jose native Danny Howland. He played in jazz and metal bands and dabbled in making big room house before launching his current dubstep project in 2015. He incorporates stunts and magic into his live shows. During a set at the Hollywood Palladium, the masked DJ appeared to levitate before a stunned crowd while performing his dubstep track “Terrible.” SVDDEN DEATH’s nine-track 2019 effort "VOYD Vol. 1.5" reached No. 8 on Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart. After being commissioned to remix Marshmello and Bastille’s 2018 hit “Happier,” SVDDEN DEATH teamed with Marshmello for 2019’s “Sell Out,” a Top 40 hit on Billboard’s Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart. The enigmatic pair kept the creative chemistry going on 2020’s “Crusade.”_ --->
11. [**Excision**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/excision/287726822): _I listened to this artist for 603 minutes (or 10.05 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Famous for being the “loudest” DJ in the bass music scene, Excision leads the community with innovative productions. He’s also founded two record labels and an annual dubstep festival. He grew up listening to mostly hip-hop and metal, taking influence from metal’s heavy guitar riffs and hip-hop’s tempo and flow. An early adopter of dubstep’s grimy sound, he broke out with 2009’s "Boom" EP, featuring UK-based Flux Pavilion and fellow Canadian Datsik. All four of Excision’s studio albums have made Billboard’s Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart, and three went Top 10. He’s also released numerous compilations, EPs, DJ mixes, and singles. In 2013, he formed the dubstep trio Destroid, with Downlink and KJ Sawka joining on midi guitars and drums. He earned the title of “loudest DJ” in 2012 when he went on tour with an ear-busting 100,000-watt sound system. He upped the voltage again in 2014 with a 150,000-watt unit, and he continues to perform remarkably loud concerts. Dedicating himself to heavy sounds, Excision launched the dinosaur-themed, bass-centric Lost Lands Festival in 2017. His most popular tracks are some of his more recent ones -- many of which incorporate more melodic elements to expand his sound._ --->
12. [**The Crazy World of Arthur Brown**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/the-crazy-world-of-arthur-brown/13119603): _I listened to them for 550 minutes (or 9.17 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Not available._ --->
13. [**Prince**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/prince/155814): _I listened to this artist for 388 minutes (or 6.47 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _In the early 2000s, the filmmaker Kevin Smith contacted Prince to see if he could use one of Prince’s songs in one of his movies. Prince responded by asking Smith to make a documentary about him. Smith said sure, but the project never got off the ground. When Smith tried to pull out, one of Prince’s assistants explained to him that it wasn’t that simple. "Why not?" Smith asked. After all, he wasn’t even a documentarian; he made features. "I get it," the assistant said -- but Prince doesn’t understand reality like the rest of do. Prince... Prince calls you at three in the morning to ask if he can get a camel. He isn’t doing it to be a jerk. But he does want the camel. It’s a funny story, of course. But it also illustrates the strength and commitment of Prince’s vision. The camel is an extreme example. But imagine you told him there was no way to mix new wave and psychedelia with funk and R&B. Or that a man couldn’t explore androgyny without risking his sex appeal. Imagine, really, telling Prince there were any conventional boundaries he had to respect -- and then imagine how much groundbreaking art would’ve been lost if he’d listened. Born Prince Rogers Nelson in 1958, he trained in ballet as a teenager, starting his music career just out of high school. By 24, he’d already released a body of work (including "Dirty Mind," "Controversy," and "1999") that helped shape nearly every style of ‘80s pop music, black and white; by 30, he was both a midnight-movie cult hero ("Purple Rain") and a Beatles-level visionary ("Sign o’ the Times"). To read about his Paisley Park compound is to get a glimpse of a world of almost perpetual creativity -- between his debut in 1978 and his death in 2016, there was barely a year he didn’t put out an album, and there were several years during which he put out two. He was one of pop music’s true universals, and yet always distinctly black. And to listen to him mix sexual ecstasy with spiritual transcendence (“When Doves Cry,” “If I Was Your Girlfriend”) not only finished the mission Little Richard started, it delivered on rock ’n' roll’s promise that you could find heaven here on earth if you were willing to shake for it._ --->
14. [**Emorfik**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/emorfik/1472308074): _I listened to this artist for 383 minutes (or 6.38 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _Not available._ --->
15. [**Kendrick Lamar**](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/kendrick-lamar/368183298): _I listened to this artist for 373 minutes (or 6.22 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this artist on Apple Music... _In an interview with Apple Music, Kendrick Lamar reflected on his 2015 album "To Pimp a Butterfly" -- in particular, the song “Alright.” It wasn’t that it sold well (it did). It wasn’t that it won awards (it did). It wasn’t even that it broke new ground for where hip-hop might go. For Lamar, the success was that people sang it in the streets. “A lot of people don’t have voices out there,” he said. “So to see them actually express themselves through song, through lyrics that I wrote?” For a kid from Compton whose life was transformed by hip-hop, the fame was nice, but the singing, the spirit, the possibility that his music was opening a cultural inroad for people joining the fight for civil rights -- that was real. He might’ve been writing alone. But he was speaking for many. Born in 1987, Lamar grew up under the influence of JAY-Z, Eminem, and 2Pac -- for the wordplay, for the imagination, for the heart and sense of community. Given its popularity, Lamar’s music can be surprisingly dense, taking shape in winding, album-length narratives ("good kid, m.A.A.d city"), live-band hybrids of jazz and funk ("To Pimp a Butterfly"), and quasi-conceptual explorations of self (2017’s Pulitzer Prize–winning "DAMN."). Yes, he wants greatness. But he wants it on his own terms. “I’m not doing it to have a good song,” he said. “Or one good rap. Or a good hook, or a good bridge. I want to keep doing it every time, period. And to do it every time you have to challenge yourself, and you have to confirm to yourself -- not anybody else -- that you’re the best.” Five years after the release of "DAMN.," Lamar continued his self-administered competition with "Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers," an album that was as cathartic as it was exhilarating. Cultivated during a time he sought therapy, the release saw the rapper find creativity, controversy, and clarity as he unearthed the dormant trauma beneath his own rap stardom. Inventive and unsparing, the LP gave new dimensionality to an artist and an entire community, proving that, sometimes, the best tests are the ones we give ourselves._ --->

Here were my top albums for the year:
1. [**"Stung!" by Pond**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/stung/1732063146): _I listened to this album for 986 minutes (or 16.43 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _Pond’s natural penchant for bombast made the Perth quintet perennial candidates for turning in a double album, and this 10th LP finally makes it happen. Stung! plays like a robust showreel of everything the band does so well, from the glam flourishes of “(I’m) Stung” and Day-Glo bluster of “Neon River” to the tight, Prince-ly funk of “So Lo” and Beach Boys-esque harmonies and hues of “Last Elvis.” Sudden scene changes are always a given with Pond: Observe how the dank drum-fills and Sabbath-style vocal effects of “Black Lung” lead right to the understated quietude of “Sunrise for the Lonely.” Through it all, singer/guitarist Nick Allbrook leads the chameleonic efforts of multi-instrumentalists Jay Watson, Jamie Terry, Joe Ryan, and James Ireland on an extended roller coaster of contrasts. Packing the most disparate elements into a single sitting is “Edge of the World Pt. 3,” an eight-minute odyssey featuring dreamy flute and sax from guest Thea Woodward and a monster guitar solo by Dungen’s Reine Fiske. And yet Allbrook’s coolly charismatic stewardship keeps the album feeling more coherent than chaotic, right up until the well-earned comedown of the closing ballad, “Fell From Grace With the Sea.”_ --->
2. [**"CRISIS VISION" by MUST DIE!**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/crisis-vision/1562203803): _I listened to this album for 905 minutes (or 15.08 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _Not available._ --->
3. [**"We Got It From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service" by A Tribe Called Quest**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/we-got-it-from-here-thank-you-4-your-service/1173106678): _I listened to this album for 889 minutes (or 14.82 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _On their final album, Q-Tip, Phife Dawg, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and Jarobi rekindle a chemistry that endeared them to hip-hop fans worldwide. Filled with exploratory instrumental beds, creative samples, supple rhyming, and serious knock, it passes the headphone and car stereo test. “Kids...” is like a rap nerd’s fever dream, Andre 3000 and Q-Tip slaying bars. Phife -- who passed away in March 2016 -- is the album’s scion, his roughneck style and biting humor shining through on “Black Spasmodic” and “Whateva Will Be.” “We the People” and “The Killing Season” (featuring Kanye West) show ATCQ’s ability to move minds as well as butts. "We got it from Here... Thank You 4 Your Service" is not a wake or a comeback -- it’s an extended visit with a long-missed friend, and a mic-dropping reminder of Tribe’s importance and influence._ --->
4. [**"Digital Artifice" by Ternion Sound**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/digital-artifice/1707168470): _I listened to this album for 886 minutes (or 14.77 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _Not available._ --->
5. [**"Neon Pill" by Cage the Elephant**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/neon-pill/1733061411): _I listened to this album for 826 minutes (or 13.77 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _Cage the Elephant’s "Neon Pill" arrives five years after their 2019 Grammy-winning global breakthrough "Social Cues." Brothers and bandleaders Matt and Brad Shultz lost their father in the interim, the group mourned the death of friends, and Matt spent time in the hospital with severe depression. This tragedy, fight, spirit, and resolve is messily and triumphantly wrapped into "Neon Pill," an album that finds the band forging their own sound devoid of outside influence, channeling their rollicking live show into a meditation on life, death, and music’s healing power. Take the psych-folk-leaning title track, which tells the story of Matt’s battle with mental illness, looking for answers but only finding more questions. As the band so often does, they mask dark and searching lyrics with melodic candy, making these philosophical queries go down more easily. On the track, Matt sings: “It's a hit and run, oh no/Double-crossed by a neon pill/Like a loaded gun, my love/I lost control of the wheel/Double-crossed by a neon pill.” Just like the story of the band over the past five years, the track includes a phoenix-like resurgence: “Knocked down, not out, let's roll."_ --->
6. [**"Midnight Marauders" by A Tribe Called Quest**](https://music.apple.com/bj/album/midnight-marauders/265670545): _I listened to this album for 705 minutes (or 11.75 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _A Tribe Called Quest helped give rap music a new sound and attitude on albums like 1990's "People's Instinctive Travels and the Paths of Rhythm" and 1991's "The Low End Theory," where the quartet's casual cool, jazz-heavy sample crate, and free-wheeling experimentation contributed to the nascent movement eventually dubbed "alternative hip-hop." Their third album, 1993's "Midnight Marauders," may not be as influential, but it could be their most beloved. Released the same year as Wu-Tang Clan's "Enter the Wu-Tang," KRS-One's "Return of the Boom Bap," and Black Moon's "Enta Da Stage," the album was perhaps the lushest and funkiest in a movement of technically proficient, rhythmically propulsive, purist-friendly rap music taking the art form back to its hard-hitting New York roots. Tribe’s melodies still chilled in that mellow nexus of ’70s jazz, funk, and soul -- think Roy Ayers, George Duke, Minnie Riperton, and Weldon Irvine -- but their drums cracked and knocked like they were made to blow headphone speakers. Hit singles like "Electric Relaxation" and "Award Tour" (the group's highest charting song to date) represent the album's commitment to calm demeanors, rugged beats, and pop savvy. The group continued the conscious streak that made them rap legends: "Sucka N****" is rapper Q-Tip's complicated thesis on the politics of using the N-word, which had been going through the process of being reclaimed by fellow rappers. But the album's most iconic lines were giddy fun that set them apart. Though there's no shortage of Phife Dawg gems here, few can top this boast from "Oh My God": "Mr. Energetic/Who me, sound pathetic?/When's the last time you heard a funky diabetic?"_ --->
7. [**"9 (Deluxe Edition)" by Pond**](https://music.apple.com/us/album/9-deluxe-edition/1609979176): _I listened to this album for 689 minutes (or 11.48 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _Western Australian psych-rock band Pond’s ninth album might have been their first in over a decade that was recorded entirely on home turf (for pandemic reasons), but thematically it darts all over the place. There are biographical moments, with reflections on traveling, meaningful encounters, and thought-provoking conversations. There are observations on modern life, ancient mythology, gentrification, and tourism. There are wild improvisations taken from frenzied jam sessions, collaborations with artists near and dear to the band, ideas drawn from other creative minds and works, with lyrics that bounce from profound to funny to delightfully absurd. All in all, "9" feels like a series of musical vignettes, often focused entirely on a single person, thought, memory, or moment._ --->

10. [**"Random Access Memories (10th Anniversary Edition)" by Daft Punk**](https://music.apple.com/bj/album/random-access-memories-10th-anniversary-edition/1673536063): _I listened to this album for 486 minutes (or 8.10 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _There is an early Daft Punk track named “Teachers” that, effectively, served as a roll call for the French duo’s influences: Paul Johnson, DJ Funk, DJ Sneak. Within the context of 1997’s "Homework," “Teachers” presented the group as bright kids ready to absorb the lessons of those who came before them. But it also marked Daft Punk as a group with a strong, dynamic relationship to the past whose music served an almost dialogic function: They weren’t just expressing themselves, they were talking to their inspirations -- a conversation that spanned countries, decades, styles and technological revolutions. So while the live-band-driven sound of 2013’s "Random Access Memories" was a curveball, it was also a logical next step. The theatricality that had alway been part of their stage show and presentation found its musical outlet (“Giorgio by Moroder”, the Paul Williams feature “Touch”), and the soft-rock panache they started playing with on 2001’s "Discovery" got a fuller, more earnest treatment (“Within”, the Julian Casablancas feature “Instant Crush”, the I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-The Doobie Brothers moves of “Fragments of Time”). The concept, as much as the album had one, was to suggest that as great as our frictionless digital world may be, there was a sense of adventurousness and connection to the spirit of the ’70s that, if not lost, had at least been subdued. “Touch” was “All You Need Is Love” for the alienation of a post-Space Odyssey universe; “Give Life Back to Music” wasn’t just there to set the scene, it was a command -- just think of all the joy music has brought you. “Get Lucky” and “Lose Yourself to Dance” -- spotlights both for Pharrell and the pioneering work of Chic’s Nile Rodgers -- recaptured the innocence of early disco and invited their audience to do the same. There was joy in it, but there was melancholy, too: Here was a world seen through the rear-view, beautiful in part because you couldn’t quite go back to it. “As we look back at the Earth, it’s, uh, up at about 11 o’clock, about, uh, well, maybe 10 or 12 diameters,” the sampled voice of astronaut Eugene Cernan says on “Contact”. “I don't know whether that does you any good. But there's somethin’ out there.” This was the Apollo 17 mission, December 1972. It remains the last time humans have been on the moon. On its 10th anniversary, the duo are reissuing the album with a raft of unreleased demos and outtakes, as well as a new mix in Spatial Audio._ --->

12. [**"Homework (25th Anniversary Edition)" by Daft Punk**](https://music.apple.com/bj/album/homework-25th-anniversary-edition/1609438391): _I listened to this album for 485 minutes (or 8.08 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _Few records combine sonic innovation with veneration for what came before as succinctly as Daft Punk’s 1997 debut, "Homework." The title itself implies this duality: It’s a reference to both the bedroom studio where musicians Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo recorded their early house and techno productions, and a nod to the older artists the duo studied in preparation for their dance music breakthrough. Many of those musical ancestors are name-checked on the Homework track “Teachers”, on which Bangalter and Homem-Christo salute the (mostly) electronic music producers and DJs who inspired their work. That includes plenty of semi-obscure Chicago house music heroes and Detroit and UK techno champions, many of whom predated Daft Punk by a decade -- but who were still active in the late-1990s rave scene. By tagging their peers, the members of Daft Punk were expressing solidarity with the many BIPOC artists whom they’d obsessed over for years. It was a declaration of belonging that could have come off as appropriation, had "Homework" not so fully elevated the genre. Bangalter and Homem-Christo might wear their influences on their sleeve, but their music transcends mere tribute; it’s some of the most unforgettable hook-laden house and techno ever put to wax. When it comes to the dance floor, if a record’s hot, that record is hot. And DJs across the globe pumped Homework’s 16 tracks, which included everything from playful filtered disco (“Revolution 909”) to throttling acid techno (“Rollin’ & Scratchin’”). Meanwhile, radio jocks and MTV programmers on the lookout for format-friendly versions of popular rave sounds swooned over "Homework" cuts like “Da Funk” and “Around the World”, which became breakout hits, thanks to inventive videos directed, respectively, by Spike Jonez and Michel Gondry. That near-impossible confluence of talent and timing allowed Homework to achieve its position atop every list of 1990s electronic music. As time went on, the members of Daft Punk would prove themselves worthy of every accolade "Homework" received as they continued to evolve from students to teachers to masters -- elevating the state of electronic music every step of the way._ --->
13. [**"Innervisions" by Stevie Wonder**](https://music.apple.com/bj/album/innervisions/1440806790): _I listened to this album for 469 minutes (or 7.82 hours)._ <!--- Here is the description for this album on Apple Music... _On the heels of his first post-Motown-emancipation masterpiece "Music of My Mind," 1972 was Stevie Wonder’s biggest year yet. He opened for The Rolling Stones on their enormous US summer tour, exposing his exploratory soul-funk hybrid to countless rock fans, and released his second opus "Talking Book" before the end of the year. An April 1973 Rolling Stone interview dubbed the erstwhile teen-pop star “The Formerly Little Stevie Wonder” and quoted the 23-year-old as saying that he wanted to “get in as much weird shit as possible”; 1973’s "Innervisions" was a start. The boldest political statement of Wonder’s career yet -- assailing drug addicts, infrastructural racism, charismatic con men and superficial Christians -- "Innervisions" was also deliriously funky and boundary-pushing. Wonder played and produced just about everything, with the help of his experimentally minded studio sous-chefs Malcolm Cecil and Robert Margouleff. The musical peaks were as high as Wonder would ever get, though the tone was more pointed than ever. “Living for the City” is a feverish seven-minute operetta about the unforgiving toll of urban life for the Black working class in the post-Black Power moment. With the journalistic soul of Marvin Gaye’s "What’s Going On" broadcast straight from the street corner and central booking, “Living” is among the most scathingly beautiful indictments of the American justice system. The album-ending slow burn “He’s Misstra Know-It-All” suavely identifies the character types who prey on those same marginalised people, including, many surmised, the soon-to-resign “law and order”-claiming US president. There’s salvation to be found in “Higher Ground”, an impossibly groovy sequel to Talking Book’s No. 1 funk odyssey “Superstition” that asserts Wonder’s belief in reincarnation over his trademark wah-wah clavinet and Moog bass; the tongue-in-cheek Latin workout “Don’t You Worry ’Bout a Thing”, a Dylanesque barb at a social climber delivered with a potent display of Wonder’s bottomless charm; and the hopelessly romantic “Golden Lady," which spirals upward into the kind of ecstatic joy that only Wonder could generate. Both a kiss-off to late-’60s hippie optimism and a pathway to numerous possible spiritual futures, "Innervisions" cemented Wonder as the most inspired and singular mind in 1970s American popular music._ --->
