  alt_text: 'This infrared image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (also called Webb or JWST) was taken by the NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) for the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES, program. The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. One such galaxy, JADES-GS-z14-0 (shown in the pullout), was determined to be at a redshift of 14.32 (+0.08/-0.20), making it the current record-holder for the most distant known galaxy. This corresponds to a time less than 300 million years after the big bang. In the background image, blue represents light at 0.9, 1.15, and 1.5 microns (filters F090W + F115W + F150W), green is 2.0 and 2.77 microns (F200W + F277W), and red is 3.56, 4.10, and 4.44 microns (F356W + F410M + F444W). The pullout image shows light at 0.90 and 1.15 microns (F090W + F115W) as blue, 1.50 and 2.00 microns (F150W + F200W) as green, and 2.77 microns (F277W) as red.'

With its suite of infrared instruments, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has fundamentally changed our understanding of extragalactic astronomy by providing an unprecedented view on the first stars, galaxies, and galaxy clusters. Most notably, JWST revealed an early period of galaxy formation that was more vigorous than expected based on pre-JWST predictions, finding luminous galaxies and accreting supermassive black holes less than one billion years after the Big Bang. JADES-GS-z14-0 is the best current archetype for this period of early galaxy formation and I helped discover this galaxy with a co-authored publication in Nature ([Carniani et al., 2024, Nature, 633, 318](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024Natur.633..318C/abstract)). Beyond its extreme redshift, JADES-GS-z14-0 has remarkable rest-frame UV properties: it is exceptionally luminous, relatively red, and spatially resolved. Perhaps the most intriguing property of JADES-GS-z14-0 is my photometric detection at mid-infrared wavelengths using JWST/MIRI with a first-author publication in Nature Astronomy ([Helton et al., 2024, Nature Astronomy, accepted](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240518462H/abstract)). These results suggests rapid mass assembly and metal enrichment less than 300 million years after the Big Bang.

I recently helped out with of a series of blog posts and press releases highlighting the discovery of JADES-GS-z14-0:

I then helped explain how a distant galaxy like JADES-GS-z14-0 can be observed, despite the extreme distance:

Finally, the Space Telescope Science Institute created a simulated fly-through visualization to JADES-GS-z14-0 to celebrate its discovery:
