The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. In the background image, blue represents light at 0.90, 1.15, and 1.50 microns (filters F090W + F115W + F150W), green is 2.00 and 2.77 microns (F200W + F277W), and red is 3.56, 4.10, and 4.44 microns (F356W + F410M + F444W). The pullout image shows light at 0.90 and 1.15 microns (F090W + F115W) as blue, 1.50 and 2.00 microns (F150W + F200W) as green, and 2.77 microns (F277W) as red.'

[**Link to My Year in Books on Goodreads.**](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/166566140)

I read lots of books in 2024 and tracked all of my progress on Goodreads. In this blog post, I will summarize the books that I read in 2024, starting with some infographics about my reading habits, followed by a ranked ordering of all the books that I read, and concluding with some of the best quotations from these books. 

Before getting into these things, I want to discuss my reading journey. As a child, I was an avid reader, from pre-school up until the end of high school. At the age of 5, I was reading Harry Potter; at the age of 12, I was reading classic works of literature; at the age of 18, I was reading science books about the Universe. However, when I left home to go to college in 2017, my studies and research quickly consumed my life. I suffered tremendously as an undergraduate, both emotionally and mentally, and stopped reading as a result of this. It took everything in me to stay afloat and become successful. At the end of 2023, while a graduate student and doctoral candidate, I stopped spending as much of my time on social media and started reading again. This was one of the best decisions that I could have made. I continued spending as little of my time as possible on social media while replacing this time with reading. Reading has quickly become my favorite hobby and serves as an important escape from the anxiety and stress that is ever present and pervasive in my life. I hope my journey can serve as an inspiration to you...

## Information Regarding My Reading Habits

In 2024, I read a total of 101 books from 49 unique authors. These 101 books contained a total of 39,443 pages, which suggests that my average book length was roughly 390.5 pages. For each of these 101 books, I provided a rating and wrote a review on Goodreads. I compiled the most relevant information for these 101 books in a Google spreadsheet. I subsequently analyzed my reading trends using the aforementioned spreadsheet and Python. My reading trends can be observed in the following infographics.

![books/2024_Figure_01.jpg](books/2024_Figure_01.jpg "The first of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings for the 101 books that I read. In general, I typically gave high ratings to the books that I read. More than half of these books received a perfect rating of 5 stars. The lowest rating that I gave was 2 stars. The total number of books receiving 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 star ratings were 0 (0.0%), 1 (1.0%), 10 (9.9%), 38 (37.6%), and 52 (51.5%), respectively.")
![books/2024_Figure_02.jpg](books/2024_Figure_02.jpg "The second of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings minus the average ratings for the 101 books that I read. In general, I typically gave higher ratings than average for the books that I read (as shown by the positive median value of 0.49). More than half of these books received a rating higher than the average (62.4%). On average, I gave ratings that were 0.27 stars higher than average, but with large scatter (as shown by the standard deviation of 0.70).")
![books/2024_Figure_03.jpg](books/2024_Figure_03.jpg "The third of these infographics provides line graphs for the number of pages that I read on a given day. These line graphs are provided as running averages over two timescales: 7-day running averages are shown in blue while 30-day running averages are shown in pink. Averaged over the entire year, I read roughly 107.8 pages per day. I typically read one page per minute (although this is subject to large scatter, depending on the author and genre of the book I am reading). This suggests that I spent nearly 2 hours per day reading: roughly 7.5% of my time was spent reading in 2024!")
![books/2024_Figure_04.jpg](books/2024_Figure_04.jpg "Finally, the fourth of these infographics provides a pie chart for the genres of books that I read. In general, I read roughly 5.7 pieces of fiction for each piece of non-fiction. The works of fiction that I read were predominantly science fiction but also included collections of short stories, classics, fantasy, and historical fiction. The works of non-fiction that I read were predominantly related to science but also included history. I am hoping to increase my fractional rate of non-fiction in 2025!")

## Some Of My Favorite Quotations From All These Books

- **"Tiger got to hunt, bird got to fly; Man got to sit and wonder 'why, why, why?' Tiger got to sleep, bird go to land; Man got to tell himself he understand."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr._
- **"There is love enough in this world for everybody, if people will just look."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr._
- **"Of all the words of mice and men, the saddest are, 'It might have been.'"**
  - _This quotation is from "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr._
- **"Beware of the man who works hard to learn something, learns it, and finds himself no wiser than before... He is full of murderous resentment of people who are ignorant without having come by their ignorance the hard way."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr._
- **"In the beginning, God created the earth, and he looked upon it in His cosmic loneliness. And God said, 'Let Us make living creatures out of mud, so the mud can see what We have done.' And God created every living creature that now moveth, and one was man. Mud as man alone could speak. God leaned close as mud as man sat up, looked around, and spoke. Man blinked. 'What is the purpose of all this?' he asked politely. 'Everything must have a purpose?' asked God. 'Certainly,' said man. 'Then I leave it to you to think of one for all of this,' said God. And He went away."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cat's Cradle" by Kurt Vonnegut Jr._
- **"Mass conversion. As the great Albert Einstein once said: E = mc^2. There’s an absurd amount of energy in mass. A modern nuclear plant can power an entire city for a year with the energy stored in just one kilogram of Uranium. Yes. That’s it. The entire output of a nuclear reactor for a year comes from a single kilogram of mass. Astrophage can, apparently, do this in either direction. It takes heat energy and somehow turns it into mass. Then when it wants the energy back, it turns that mass back into energy — in the form of Petrova-frequency light. And it uses that to propel itself along in space. So not only is it a perfect energy-storage medium, it’s a perfect spaceship engine. Evolution can be insanely effective when you leave it alone for a few billion years..."**
  - _This quotation is from "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir._
- **CERN is going to release this paper next week. This is a rough draft. But I know everyone there, so they let me see an advance copy... They figured out how Astrophage stores energy... Long story short: It’s neutrinos... It’s very counterintuitive. But there’s a large neutrino burst every time they kill an Astrophage. They even took samples to the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and punctured them in the main detector pool. They got a massive number of hits. Astrophage can only contain neutrinos if it’s alive, and there’s a lot of them in there... This is more your area than mine, but microbiologists have confirmed Astrophage has a lot of free hydrogen ions — raw protons with no electron — zipping around just inside the cell membrane... CERN is pretty sure that, through a mechanism we don’t understand, when those protons collide at a high enough velocity, their kinetic energy is converted into two neutrinos with opposite momentum vectors... Sometimes gamma rays, when they pass close to an atomic nucleus, will spontaneously become an electron and a positron. It’s called 'pair production.' So it’s not unheard-of. But we’ve never seen neutrinos created that way... Astrophage makes neutrinos in pairs by slamming protons together. For the reaction to work, the protons need to collide with a higher kinetic energy than the mass energy of two neutrinos. If you work backward from the mass of a neutrino, you know the velocity those protons have to collide at. And when you know the velocity of particles in an object, you know its temperature. To have enough kinetic energy to make neutrinos, the protons have to be 96.415 degrees Celsius... Any heat energy above the critical temperature gets quickly converted into neutrinos. But if it drops below critical temperature, the protons are going too slow and neutrino production stop. End result: You can’t get it hotter than 96.415 degrees. Not for long, anyway. And if it gets too cold, the Astrophage uses stored energy to heat back up to that temperature — just like any other warm-blooded life-form... Neutrinos are what’s called Majorana particles. It means the neutrino is its own antiparticle. Basically, every time two neutrinos collide, it’s a matter-antimatter interaction. They annihilate and become photons. Two photons, actually, with the same wavelength and going opposite directions... The mass energy of a neutrino is exactly the same as the energy found in one photon of Petrova-wavelength light. This paper is truly groundbreaking... Neutrinos routinely pass through the entire planet Earth without hitting a single atom — they’re just that small. Well, it’s more about quantum wavelengths and probabilities of collision. But suffice it to say, neutrinos are family hard to interact with. But for some reason, Astrophage has what we call 'super cross-sectionality.' That’s just a fancy term meaning nothing can quantum-tunnel through it. It goes against every law of particle physics we thought we knew, but it’s been proven over and over...**
  - _This quotation is from "Project Hail Mary" by Andy Weir._
- **Planets get magnetic fields if the conditions are right. You have to have a molten-iron core, you have to be in the magnetic field of a star, and you have to be spinning. If all three of these things are the, you get a magnetic field. Earth has one — that’s why compasses work. Erid has all of those features on steroids. They are larger than Earth with a larger iron core. They are close to their star, so they have a much stronger magnetic field powering their own field, and they spin extremely fast. All told, Erid’s magnetic field is at least twenty-five times as strong as Earth’s. Plus, their atmosphere is extremely thick. Twenty-nine times as thick. You know what strong magnetic fields and thick atmospheres are really good at? Radiation protection. All life on Earth evolved to deal with radiation. Our DNA has error-correction built in because we’re constantly bombarded with radiation from the sun and from space in general. Our magnetic field and atmosphere protect us somewhat, but not 100 percent. For Erid, it’s 100 percent. Radiation just doesn’t get to the ground. Light doesn’t even get to the ground — that’s why they never evolved eyes. The surface is pitch-dark... Eridians are extremely acceptable to radiation, and they never even knew it existed...**

- **"We now take our final step outwards, arriving at the extraordinary viewpoint that takes in our entire observable universe. On this largest scale the universe appears as an intricate network of galaxy superclusters that together contain about 100 billion galaxies. Those galaxies are themselves huddled together throughout space in their smaller collections of clusters and galaxy groups. Each of those galaxies has around 100 billion stars, and a huge number of those stars will have their own systems of planets orbiting around them. With such numbers, it is no wonder that most astronomers suspect that life exists in some form elsewhere in the cosmos."**

- **"What does our universe look like beyond the horizon? We think that it continues on, more or less the same, far beyond the part that we can see. We do not think it has an edge, an idea we will come back to in chapter 4. Perhaps the universe is infinite, as hard as that might be to visualize. However large it is, it most likely contains more of the same: more superclusters, containing more galaxies, containing more stars and planets. This might sound superficially boring, but with a moment’s thought we can start to imagine what incredible richness and diversity there must be out there. How many galaxies, how many stars, how many planets — and how many of those might be hosts to life?"**

- **"Returning now to our place in the universe, we locate ourselves on our small planet traveling around the Sun. Our Sun is surrounded in space by its neighboring stars, many of them encircled by their own tiny planets. Our neighboring stars move around in the longer spiraling arm of stars that makes up part of our larger home, the Milky Way galaxy. Our galaxy, a huge disc of stars and gas embedded in a much larger halo of invisible dark matter, is spinning gently around. We look out to our neighboring galaxy, the majestic spiraling Andromeda, slowly moving towards us through the depths of space. Around us there are many more galaxies, scattered through space and grouped together in smaller groups or larger clusters. Inside them, stars are born and die. Further out, we find more galaxies in their groups and clusters, as far as we can see. If we look far enough, we see them grouped into even larger structures, the megalopolis-like superclusters. The galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the bright lights on the backbone of the universe, the web of dark matter... We now take our final step outwards, arriving at the extraordinary viewpoint that takes in our entire observable universe. On this largest scale the universe appears as an intricate network of galaxy superclusters that together contain about 100 billion galaxies. Those galaxies are themselves huddled together throughout space in their smaller collections of clusters and galaxy groups.

- **''Billy looked at the clock on the gas stove. He had an hour to kill before the saucer came. He went into the living room, swinging the bottle like a dinner bell, turned on the television. He came slightly unstuck in time, saw the movie backwards, then forwards again. It was a movie about American bombers in the Second World War and the gallant men who flew them. Seen backwards by Billy, the story went like this: American planes, full of holes and wounded men and corpses took off backwards from an airfield in England. Over France, a few German fighter planes flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation. The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored nearly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody as good as new. When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again. The American fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. And Hitler turned into a baby, Billy Pilgrim supposed. That wasn’t in the movie. Billy was extrapolating. Everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception, conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named Adam and Eve, he supposed. Billy saw the war movies backward then forwards — and then it was time to go out onto his backyard to meet the flying saucer.''**

- **"I am an invisible man. No, I am not a spook like those who haunted Edgar Allan Poe, nor am I one of your Hollywood-movie ectoplasms. I am a man of substance, of flesh and bone, fiber and liquids — and I might even be said to possess a mind. I am invisible, understand, simply because people refuse to see me. Like the bodiless heads you see sometimes in circus sideshows, it is as though I have been surrounded by mirrors of hard, distorting glass. When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination — indeed, everything and anything except me."**

Never shall I forget the nocturnal silence that deprived me for all eternity of the desire to live. Never shall I forget those moments that murdered my God and my soul and turned my dreams to ashes. Never shall I forget those things, even were I condemned to live as long as God himself. Never."**

- **"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be... The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky..."**
