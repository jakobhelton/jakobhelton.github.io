The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. In the background image, blue represents light at 0.90, 1.15, and 1.50 microns (filters F090W + F115W + F150W), green is 2.00 and 2.77 microns (F200W + F277W), and red is 3.56, 4.10, and 4.44 microns (F356W + F410M + F444W). The pullout image shows light at 0.90 and 1.15 microns (F090W + F115W) as blue, 1.50 and 2.00 microns (F150W + F200W) as green, and 2.77 microns (F277W) as red.'

[**Link to My Year in Books on Goodreads.**](https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2024/166566140)

I read lots of books in 2024 and tracked all of my progress on Goodreads. In this blog post, I will summarize the books that I read in 2024, starting with some infographics about my reading habits, followed by a ranked ordering of all the books that I read, and concluding with some of the best quotations from these books. 

Before getting into these things, I want to discuss my reading journey. As a child, I was an avid reader, from pre-school up until the end of high school. At the age of 5, I was reading Harry Potter; at the age of 12, I was reading classic works of literature; at the age of 18, I was reading science books about the Universe. However, when I left home to go to college in 2017, my studies and research quickly consumed my life. I suffered tremendously as an undergraduate, both emotionally and mentally, and stopped reading as a result of this. It took everything in me to stay afloat and become successful. At the end of 2023, while a graduate student and doctoral candidate, I stopped spending as much of my time on social media and started reading again. This was one of the best decisions that I could have made. I continued spending as little of my time as possible on social media while replacing this time with reading. Reading has quickly become my favorite hobby and serves as an important escape from the anxiety and stress that is ever present and pervasive in my life. I hope my journey can serve as an inspiration to you...

## Information Regarding My Reading Habits

In 2024, I read a total of 101 books from 49 unique authors. These 101 books contained a total of 39,443 pages, which suggests that my average book length was roughly 390.5 pages. For each of these 101 books, I provided a rating and wrote a review on Goodreads. I compiled the most relevant information for these 101 books in a Google spreadsheet. I subsequently analyzed my reading trends using the aforementioned spreadsheet and Python. My reading trends can be observed in the following infographics.

![books/2024_Figure_01.jpg](books/2024_Figure_01.jpg "The first of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings for the 101 books that I read. In general, I typically gave high ratings to the books that I read. More than half of these books received a perfect rating of 5 stars. The lowest rating that I gave was 2 stars. The total number of books receiving 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 star ratings were 0 (0.0%), 1 (1.0%), 10 (9.9%), 38 (37.6%), and 52 (51.5%).")
![books/2024_Figure_02.jpg](books/2024_Figure_02.jpg "The second of these infographics provides a histogram of my ratings minus the average ratings for the 101 books that I read. In general, I typically gave higher ratings than average for the books that I read (as shown by the positive median value of 0.49). More than half of these books received a rating higher than the average (62.4%). On average, I gave ratings that were 0.27 stars higher than average, but with large scatter (as shown by the standard deviation of 0.70).")
![books/2024_Figure_03.jpg](books/2024_Figure_03.jpg "The third of these infographics provides line graphs for the number of pages that I read on a given day. These line graphs are provided as running averages over two timescales: 7-day running averages are shown in blue while 30-day running averages are shown in pink. Averaged over the entire year, I read roughly 107.8 pages per day. I typically read one page per minute (although this is subject to large scatter depending on the author and genre of the book I am reading). This suggests that I spent nearly 2 hours per day reading: roughly 7.5% of my time was spent reading in 2024!")
![books/2024_Figure_04.jpg](books/2024_Figure_04.jpg "Finally, the fourth of these infographics provides a pie chart for the genres of books that I read. In general, I read roughly 5.7 pieces of fiction for each piece of non-fiction. The works of fiction that I read were predominantly science fiction but also included collections of short stories, classics, fantasy, and historical fiction. The works of non-fiction that I read were predominantly related to science but also included history. I am hoping to increase my fractional rate of non-fiction in 2025!")

## Some Of My Favorite Quotations From All These Books

- **"The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be... The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary understanding. Lost somewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmic perspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species is young and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we have made the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our place within it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans have evolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. I believe our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a mote of dust in the morning sky..."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cosmos" by Carl Sagan._
- **"For we are the local embodiment of a Cosmos grown to self-awareness. We have begun to contemplate our origins: starstuff pondering the stars; organized assemblages of ten billion billion billion atoms considering the evolution of atoms; tracing the long journey by which, here at least, consciousness arose. Our loyalties are to the species and the planet. We speak for Earth. Our obligation to survive is owed not just to ourselves but also to that Cosmos, ancient and vast, from which we spring..."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cosmos" by Carl Sagan._
- **"The known is finite, the unknown infinite; intellectually we stand on an islet in the midst of an illimitable ocean of inexplicability. Our business in every generation is to reclaim a little more land..."**
  - _This quotation is from "Cosmos" by Carl Sagan._
- **"Returning now to our place in the universe, we locate ourselves on our small planet traveling around the Sun. Our Sun is surrounded in space by its neighboring stars, many of them encircled by their own tiny planets. Our neighboring stars move around in the longer spiraling arm of stars that makes up part of our larger home, the Milky Way galaxy. Our galaxy, a huge disc of stars and gas embedded in a much larger halo of invisible dark matter, is spinning gently around. We look out to our neighboring galaxy, the majestic spiraling Andromeda, slowly moving towards us through the depths of space. Around us there are many more galaxies, scattered through space and grouped together in smaller groups or larger clusters. Inside them, stars are born and die. Further out, we find more galaxies in their groups and clusters, as far as we can see. If we look far enough, we see them grouped into even larger structures, the megalopolis-like superclusters. The galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the bright lights on the backbone of the universe, the web of dark matter... We now take our final step outwards, arriving at the extraordinary viewpoint that takes in our entire observable universe. On this largest scale the universe appears as an intricate network of galaxy superclusters that together contain about 100 billion galaxies. Those galaxies are themselves huddled together throughout space in their smaller collections of clusters and galaxy groups. Each of those galaxies has around 100 billion stars, and a huge number of those stars will have their own systems of planets orbiting around them. With such numbers, it is no wonder that most astronomers suspect that life exists in some form elsewhere in the cosmos..."**
