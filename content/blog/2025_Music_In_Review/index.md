  alt_text: 'This infrared image from NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (also called Webb or JWST) was taken by the NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) for the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey, or JADES, program. The NIRCam data was used to determine which galaxies to study further with spectroscopic observations. In the background image, blue represents light at 0.90, 1.15, and 1.50 microns (filters F090W + F115W + F150W), green is 2.00 and 2.77 microns (F200W + F277W), and red is 3.56, 4.10, and 4.44 microns (F356W + F410M + F444W). The pullout image shows light at 0.90 and 1.15 microns (F090W + F115W) as blue, 1.50 and 2.00 microns (F150W + F200W) as green, and 2.77 microns (F277W) as red.'

I listened to lots of music in 2025, primarily digital media with Apple Music and YouTube, but also analog media with vinyls that I have been collecting. In this blog post, I will summarize the music that I listened to in 2025, starting with the top artists and albums that I listened to on Apple Music, followed by the best live performances that I listened to on YouTube, and concluding with the vinyls that I acquired this year.

In total, I listened to 1,062 unique artists and 433 unique albums. I was a top 500 listener for MUST DIE!; I was also a top 500 listener for Pond. My top genres were electronic, dance, alternative, house, and electronica. My top artists by month were Daft Punk in January, Daft Punk in February, Daft Punk in March, Skrillex in April, Skrillex in May, Daft Punk in June, Justice in July, Daft Punk in August, Justice in September, Tame Impala in October, Justice in November, and Tame Impala in December.
