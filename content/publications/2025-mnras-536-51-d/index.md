title: 'JWST/NIRSpec WIDE survey: a z = 4.6 low-mass star-forming galaxy hosting a jet-driven shock with low ionization and solar metallicity'
abstract: 'We present NIRSpec/micro-shutter assembly observations from the JWST large-area survey WIDE, targeting the rest-frame UV-optical spectrum of Ulema, a radio-active galactic nucleus host at redshift {{< math >}}$z = 4.6348${{< /math >}}. The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent width nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionization species of oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral {{< math >}}$\mathrm{O}^{+}${{< /math >}} emission is clearly detected, possibly also {{< math >}}$\mathrm{C}^{+}${{< /math >}}. From the high-resolution grating spectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion of {{< math >}}$\sigma \sim 400\ \mathrm{km/s}${{< /math >}}, broad enough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational potential of the galaxy. Diagnostics based on emission-line ratios suggest that the nebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the physical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral energy distribution and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian framework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system ({{< math >}}$M_{\ast} = 1.4 \times 10^{10}\ M_{\odot}${{< /math >}}, {{< math >}}$\mathrm{SFR} = 70\ M_{\odot}/\mathrm{yr}${{< /math >}}), where shock-driven emission contributes 50 per cent to the total {{< math >}}$\mathrm{H}\beta${{< /math >}} luminosity. The nebular metallicity is near solar — three times higher than that predicted by the mass-metallicity relation at {{< math >}}$z = 4.6${{< /math >}}, possibly related to fast-paced chemical evolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in the star-formation rate of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast radio-mode active galactic nucleus feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming gas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo, setting the stage for future quenching.'
