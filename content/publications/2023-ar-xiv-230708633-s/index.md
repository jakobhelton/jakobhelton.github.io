title: 'JADES: deep spectroscopy of a low-mass galaxy at redshift 2.3 quenched by environment'
abstract: We report the discovery of a quiescent galaxy at {{< math >}}$z = 2.34${{< /math >}} with a stellar mass of only {{< math >}}$M_{\ast} = 9.5_{-1.2}^{+1.8} \times 10^{8}\ M_{\odot}${{< /math >}}, based on deep JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy. This is the least massive quiescent galaxy found so far at high redshift. We use a Bayesian approach to model the spectrum and photometry, and find the target to have been quiescent for {{< math >}}$0.6\ \mathrm{Gyr}${{< /math >}} with a mass-weighted average stellar age of {{< math >}}$0.8-1.7\ \mathrm{Gyr}${{< /math >}} (dominated by systematics). The galaxy displays an inverse colour gradient with radius, consistent with environment-driven quenching. Based on a combination of spectroscopic and robust (medium- and broad-band) photometric redshifts, we identify a galaxy overdensity near the location of the target ({{< math >}}$5\sigma${{< /math >}} above the background level at this redshift). We stress that had we been specifically targetting galaxies within overdensities, the main target would not have been selected on photometry alone; therefore, environment studies based on photometric redshifts are biased against low-mass quiescent galaxies. The overdensity contains three spectroscopically confirmed, massive, old galaxies ({{< math >}}$M_{\ast} = 8-17 \times 10^{10} M_{\odot}${{< /math >}}). The presence of these evolved systems points to accelerated galaxy evolution in overdensities at redshifts {{< math >}}$z > 2${{< /math >}}, in agreement with previous works. In projection, our target lies only {{< math >}}$35\ \mathrm{pkpc}${{< /math >}} away from the most massive galaxy in this overdensity (spectroscopic redshift {{< math >}}$z = 2.349${{< /math >}}) which is located close to overdensity's centre. This suggests the low-mass galaxy was quenched by environment, making it possibly the earliest evidence for environment-driven quenching to date.
