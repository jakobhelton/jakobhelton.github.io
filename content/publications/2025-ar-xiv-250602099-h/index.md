title: 'The Stellar Populations and Rest-Frame Colors of Star-Forming Galaxies at z = 8: Exploring the Impact of Filter Choice and Star Formation History Assumption with JADES'
abstract: 'Our understanding of the physical properties of star-forming galaxies during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR, at {{< math >}}$z > 6${{< /math >}}) suffers from degeneracies among the apparent properties of the stars, the nebular gas, and the dust. These degeneracies are most prominent with photometry, which has insufficient (1) spectral resolution and (2) rest-frame spectral coverage. We explore ways to break these degeneracies with a sample of {{< math >}}$N = 22${{< /math >}} high-redshift star-forming galaxies at {{< math >}}$7 < z_{\mathrm{phot}} \leq 9${{< /math >}}, using some of the deepest existing imaging from JWST/NIRCam and JWST/MIRI with JADES. Key to this study is the imaging from JWST/MIRI at {{< math >}}$7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}}, which provides coverage of the rest-frame {{< math >}}$I${{< /math >}}-band at the observed redshifts. We infer stellar population properties and rest-frame colors using a variety of filter sets and star formation history assumptions to explore the impact of these choices. Evaluating these quantities both with and without the {{< math >}}$7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}} data point shows that dense spectral coverage with JWST/NIRCam (eight or more filters, including at least one medium-band) can compensate for lacking the rest-frame {{< math >}}$I${{< /math >}}-band coverage for the vast majority ({{< math >}}$\approx 80\%${{< /math >}}) of our sample. Furthermore, these galaxy properties are most consistently determined by assuming the delayed-tau star formation history, which provides the smallest offsets and scatters around these offsets when including JWST/MIRI. Within extragalactic surveys like JADES and CEERS, our findings suggest that robust characterization of the stellar population properties and rest-frame colors for high-redshift star-forming galaxies is possible with JWST/NIRCam alone at {{< math >}}$z \approx 8${{< /math >}}.'

The grey points represent the observed photometry assuming the JADES filter set.

The dashed lines represent the medians for the Prospector models while the dotted lines represent {{< math >}}$68\%${{< /math >}} confidence intervals. Top and bottom panels: The fiducial Prospector model is described in Section 4.2 and assumes the constant SFH model. The blue (pink) squares, lines, and shaded regions represent results from fitting to the full JADES filter set, including (excluding) MIRI/F770W. For this typical galaxy, MIRI/F770W has little to no effect on the inferred SED and stellar population properties. This is true for the vast majority ({{< math >}}$\approx 80\%${{< /math >}}) of galaxies in the final photometric sample, suggesting that observations with JWST/MIRI are not needed to robustly determine the stellar population properties for typical star-forming galaxies during the EoR. The complete figure set of these typical galaxies ({{< math >}}$18${{< /math >}} figures) will be available in the online journal.'
