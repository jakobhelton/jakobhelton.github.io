title: 'Photometric detection at 7.7 microns of a galaxy beyond redshift 14 with JWST/MIRI'
abstract: 'The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has spectroscopically confirmed numerous galaxies at {{< math >}}$z > 10${{< /math >}}. While weak rest-ultraviolet emission lines have only been seen in a handful of sources, the stronger rest-optical emission lines are highly diagnostic and accessible at mid-infrared wavelengths with the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) of JWST. We report the photometric detection of the distant spectroscopically confirmed galaxy JADES-GS-z14-0 at {{< math >}}$z = 14.32_{-0.20}^{+0.08}${{< /math >}} with MIRI at {{< math >}}$7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}}. The most plausible solution for the stellar population properties is that this galaxy contains half a billion solar masses in stars with a strong burst of star formation in the most recent few million years. For this model, at least one-third of the flux at {{< math >}}$7.7\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}} comes from the rest-optical emission lines {{< math >}}$\mathrm{H}\beta${{< /math >}} and/or  {{< math >}}$\mathrm{[OIII]}\lambda\lambda4959,5007${{< /math >}}. The inferred properties of JADES-GS-z14-0 suggest rapid mass assembly and metal enrichment during the earliest phases of galaxy formation. This work demonstrates the unique power of mid-infrared observations in understanding galaxies at the redshift frontier.'

  alt_text: 'The most distant galaxy spectroscopically confirmed by the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES). This galaxy was initially selected from ultra-deep NIRCam and MIRI imaging with JWST (F770W-F277W-F115W shown as an RGB false-color mosaic in the lower right). It was targeted for NIRSpec MSA follow-up observations and is the first spectroscopically confirmed redshift {{< math >}}$z > 14${{< /math >}} system. JADES-GS-z14-0 is to the right and the foreground galaxy NIRCam ID {{< math >}}$183349${{< /math >}} to the left. The apparent color of JADES-GS-z14-0 is caused by the absorption of the NIRCam/F115W flux by the intervening IGM and the rest-frame optical nebular emission line excess in MIRI/F770W relative to NIRCam/F277W.'
