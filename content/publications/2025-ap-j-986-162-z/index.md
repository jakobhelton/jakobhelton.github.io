title: 'A Systematic Search for Galaxies with Extended Emission Line and Potential Outflows in JADES Medium-band Images'
abstract: 'For the first time, we present a systematic search for galaxies with extended emission lines and potential outflows features using JWST medium-band images in the GOODS south field. This is done by comparing the morphology in medium-band images to adjacent continuum and UV bands. We look for galaxies that have a maximum extent {{< math >}}$50\%${{< /math >}} larger, an excess area {{< math >}}$30\%${{< /math >}} greater, or an axis ratio difference of more than {{< math >}}$0.3${{< /math >}} in the medium band compared to the reference bands. After visual inspection, we find {{< math >}}$326${{< /math >}} candidate galaxies at {{< math >}}$1.4 < z < 8.4${{< /math >}}, with a peak in the population near cosmic noon, benefiting from the good coverage of the medium-band filters. By fitting their spectral energy distributions, we find that the candidate galaxies are at least {{< math >}}$20\%${{< /math >}} more bursty in their star-forming activity and have {{< math >}}$50\%${{< /math >}} more young stellar populations compared to a control sample selected based on the continuum band flux. Additionally, these candidates exhibit a significantly higher production rate of ionizing photons. We further find that candidates hosting known active galactic nuclei (AGN) produce extended emission that is more anisotropic compared to non-AGN candidates. A few of our candidates have been spectroscopically confirmed to have prominent outflow signatures through NIRSpec observations, showcasing the robustness of the photometric selection. Future spectroscopic follow-up will better help verify and characterize the kinematics and chemical properties of these systems.'
