title: 'Identification of High-redshift Galaxy Overdensities in GOODS-N and GOODS-S'
abstract: 'We conduct a systematic search for high-redshift galaxy overdensities at {{< math >}}$4.9 < z_{\mathrm{spec}} < 8.9${{< /math >}} in both the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS)-N and GOODS-S fields using James Webb Space Telescope/Near-Infrared Camera (JWST/NIRCam) imaging from the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey and JWST Extragalactic Medium-band Survey in addition to JWST/NIRCam wide field slitless spectroscopy from the First Reionization Epoch Spectroscopic Complete Survey. High-redshift galaxy candidates are identified using Hubble Space Telescope + JWST photometry spanning {{< math >}}$\lambda = 0.4-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}}. We confirmed the redshifts for roughly a third of these galaxies using JWST spectroscopy over {{< math >}}$\lambda = 3.9-5.0\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}} through identification of either {{< math >}}$\mathrm{H}\alpha${{< /math >}} or {{< math >}}$\mathrm{[OIII]}\lambda5008${{< /math >}} around the best-fit photometric redshift. The rest-ultraviolet magnitudes and continuum slopes of these galaxies were inferred from the photometry: the brightest and reddest objects appear in more dense environments and thus are surrounded by more galaxy neighbors than their fainter and bluer counterparts, suggesting accelerated galaxy evolution within overdense environments. We find {{< math >}}$17${{< /math >}} significant ({{< math >}}$\delta_{\mathrm{gal}} \geq 3.04${{< /math >}}, {{< math >}}$N_{\mathrm{gal}} \geq 4${{< /math >}}) galaxy overdensities across both fields (seven in GOODS-N and {{< math >}}$10${{< /math >}} in GOODS-S), including the two highest redshift spectroscopically confirmed galaxy overdensities to date at and (representing densities around {{< math >}}$\sim 6${{< /math >}} and {{< math >}}$\sim 12${{< /math >}} times that of a random volume). We estimate the total halo mass of these large-scale structures to be {{< math >}}$11.5 \leq \mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot}) \leq 13.4${{< /math >}} using an empirical stellar mass-to-halo mass relation, which are likely underestimates as a result of incompleteness. These protocluster candidates are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with {{< math >}}$\mathrm{log}_{10}(M_{\mathrm{halo}}/M_{\odot}) \gtrsim 14${{< /math >}} by {{< math >}}$z = 0${{< /math >}}.'

  caption: '3d large-scale structure of the overdense galaxy environment at {{< math >}}$5.285 < z_{\mathrm{spec}} < 5.490${{< /math >}} in GOODS-S. The on-sky distribution in physical units for the {{< math >}}$N = 68${{< /math >}} galaxies that fall within the given comoving volume are color-coded by their spectroscopic redshift. Spatial offsets are measured relative to the median position and redshift of the given sample. The squares represent galaxies that are confirmed members of JADES−GS−OD−5.386 and the transparent circles represent confirmed members of the field. This galaxy overdensity resides in a complex environment with connected filamentary structures.'
