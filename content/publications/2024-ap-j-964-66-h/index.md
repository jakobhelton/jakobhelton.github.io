title: 'Brown Dwarf Candidates in the JADES and CEERS Extragalactic Surveys'
abstract: 'By combining the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRCam JADES and CEERS extragalactic data sets, we have uncovered a sample of {{< math >}}$21${{< /math >}} T and Y brown dwarf candidates at best-fit distances between {{< math >}}$0.1${{< /math >}} and {{< math >}}$4.2\ \mathrm{kpc}${{< /math >}}. These sources were selected by targeting the blue {{< math >}}$1-2.5\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}} colors and red {{< math >}}$3-4.5\ \mu\mathrm{m}${{< /math >}} colors that arise from molecular absorption in the atmospheres of {{< math >}}$T_{\mathrm{eff}} < 1300\ \mathrm{K}${{< /math >}} brown dwarfs. We fit these sources using multiple models of substellar atmospheres and present the resulting fluxes, sizes, effective temperatures, and other derived properties for the sample. If confirmed, these fits place the majority of the sources in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We observe proper motions for seven of the candidate brown dwarfs, with directions in agreement with the plane of our Galaxy, providing evidence that they are not extragalactic in nature. We demonstrate how the colors of these sources differ from selected high-redshift galaxies, and explore the selection of these sources in planned large-area JWST NIRCam surveys. Deep imaging with JWST/NIRCam presents an an excellent opportunity for finding and understanding these ultracool dwarfs at kiloparsec distances.'
