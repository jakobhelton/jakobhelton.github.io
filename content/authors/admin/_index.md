## About Me

I am currently an Evolving Universe Postdoctoral Fellow at The Pennsylvania State University. I received an A.B. in astrophysical sciences with high honors from Princeton University in addition to an M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy and astrophysics from the University of Arizona. I spend my time studying (#1) high-redshift galaxies, (#2) high-redshift galaxy clusters, and (#3) the large-scale structure of the Universe. I am a key member of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in addition to the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) and Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) Science Teams. My contributions to extragalactic astronomy have been featured in national and international press, and I have worked to share my work and acquired knowledge with the broader community. I have extensive experience in academic research, problem solving, public speaking, and technical writing. In addition to my research, I am also a visual artist. I focus on photography and painting, but I have recently started creating digital images and movies. In the coming years, I am hoping to publish a photography book and get my work featured in an art exhibition.
